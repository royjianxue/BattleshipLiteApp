# BattleshipLiteApp
IAmTimCorey C# Foundation Project

This is project is not MY OWN. This is a line by line project from C# MasterCourse from IamTimCorey. This project is just for learning purposes.


Project Requirement:

To Build a small, two-player console game that has its roots in the game Battleship from Mattel.
There will be a 25-spot grid (A1 - E5). Each player will place five pegs on the board to represent their five ships.
Players will then take turns firing on their opponent's ships. 
The first person to sink all five ships wins.


What I have learned:

This project was difficult for me to grasp even though I had learned all the basics to be able to understand the coding logic of this game project
Throughout creating and following the project code line by line, it reinforces a lot of the foundational concepts of programming logics for me.
I learned how to plan the project before proceed to write the code.
I learned to create different classes to hold different methods
I learned single resposibility Rule where a method should only do one thing
I also learned the DRY concept where it stands for do not repear your code.. and we can wrap then in a method so it can be reused
I learned about enum, it is a value type where it has the power to give a set of named constants a underlying integral numeric. assigned the status to various constant such as Empty, Miss, Hit, Sunk

What I plan to do:

I do not plan on building on top of this project.
But I do plan on using similar concept to build a Tic Tac Toe game. To come :)
